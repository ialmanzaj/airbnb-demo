# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Wishlist Feature

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing a Wishlist feature in our Airbnb clone application. The feature will allow users to save their favorite property listings by pressing a heart icon on the property card, adding the listing to a wishlist stored in the database.

### 1.2 Scope
The Wishlist feature will be integrated into the existing property listing interface, specifically within the `PropertyCard` component. It will involve frontend UI updates, database schema modifications, and backend logic to manage wishlist data.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- End Users: Travelers and property seekers using the app to browse and save listings.
- Developers: Team members who will implement and maintain this feature.
- Stakeholders: Product managers and business analysts tracking feature adoption.

## 2. Feature Overview

### 2.1 Feature Description
Users will be able to add a property listing to their wishlist by pressing a heart icon on the `PropertyCard`. This action will save the listing ID to a wishlist collection in the InstantDB database. The heart icon will visually indicate whether the listing is in the user's wishlist through an animated state transition.

### 2.2 User Story
- As a user, I want to save properties I'm interested in by tapping a heart icon on the PropertyCard, so that I can easily find them later in my wishlist.
- As a user, I want immediate visual feedback when I add/remove a property to my wishlist.

### 2.3 Success Criteria
- Users can add/remove listings to/from their wishlist with a single tap
- Wishlist status is visually reflected on the property card with smooth animations:
  - Outlined heart → Filled heart with scale animation when adding
  - Filled heart → Outlined heart with fade animation when removing
- Wishlist data persists across app sessions and is synced with the database
- Heart icon interaction is responsive (< 100ms feedback)
- Feature achieves at least 20% engagement from active users within the first month

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. **UI Element**: 
   - Add a heart icon button to the `PropertyCard` component
   - Position in top-right corner with proper padding and touch target size
   - Support both light and dark mode with appropriate contrast
2. **Toggle Functionality**: 
   - Tapping the heart icon triggers optimistic UI update
   - Implement debouncing to prevent rapid repeated taps
   - Handle edge cases (network errors, concurrent updates)
3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Heart icon smoothly animates between states using React Native Reanimated
   - Add subtle haptic feedback on state change
   - Show loading state during network operations
4. **Database Integration**: 
   - Store wishlist entries in InstantDB with listing ID and timestamp
   - Implement batch operations for efficient updates
   - Cache wishlist status locally for improved performance

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: 
   - UI updates should feel instantaneous (< 16ms)
   - Wishlist actions should complete within 500ms under normal network conditions
   - Implement request queuing for offline support
2. **Scalability**: Database schema should support thousands of wishlist entries per user without performance degradation
3. **Accessibility**: 
   - Heart icon button must have proper ARIA labels
   - Minimum touch target size of 44x44 points
   - Support VoiceOver/TalkBack with meaningful descriptions

### 3.3 System Requirements
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo, using existing `PropertyCard` component.
- **Backend**: InstantDB for storing wishlist data.
- **Authentication**: Integration with existing user authentication system.

## 4. Design Specifications

### 4.1 UI Mockups
- **Property Card with Heart Icon**:
  - Heart icon: 24x24dp, positioned 16dp from top and right edges
  - Touch target: 44x44dp centered on icon
  - Default state: Outlined heart with 2dp stroke width
  - Active state: Filled heart with brand color
  - Loading state: Subtle pulse animation
  - Transition: 300ms spring animation between states

### 4.2 User Flow
1. User views property listings on the home screen
2. User taps heart icon on a property card
3. Heart icon immediately animates to filled state
4. Wishlist update is sent to InstantDB
5. On success: No visible change (already optimistically updated)
6. On error: Revert animation, show toast notification

### 4.3 Database Schema Changes
- New collection in InstantDB: `wishlist`
  - Fields:
    - `id`: Unique identifier for wishlist entry.
    - `userId`: ID of the user who saved the listing.
    - `listingId`: ID of the saved property listing.
    - `createdAt`: Timestamp when the listing was added to wishlist.

## 5. Technical Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phases
1. **Phase 1: Schema Update**
   - Update InstantDB schema to include `wishlist` collection.
   - Deploy schema changes.
2. **Phase 2: Authentication Check**
   - Ensure user authentication state is accessible in the app.
   - Implement login prompt for unauthenticated users attempting to use wishlist.
3. **Phase 3: UI Implementation**
   - Add heart icon to `PropertyCard` component.
   - Implement toggle state logic and visual feedback.
4. **Phase 4: Database Integration**
   - Add functions to add/remove wishlist entries in InstantDB.
   - Query wishlist status for listings on screen.
5. **Phase 5: Testing and Deployment**
   - Write unit tests for wishlist toggle functionality.
   - Conduct integration testing for database operations.
   - Deploy feature to production with monitoring.

### 5.2 Dependencies
- **InstantDB**: For database operations.
- **Authentication System**: For user identification.
- **UI Library**: For heart icon (likely from `lucide-react-native`).

### 5.3 Risks
- **Database Sync Issues**: Potential delays in wishlist status updates due to network issues. Mitigation: Implement local state updates with optimistic UI.
- **User Authentication**: Complexity in handling unauthenticated users. Mitigation: Clear login prompts and fallback behavior.
- **Performance**: Excessive database queries for wishlist status. Mitigation: Batch queries and cache results where possible.

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Test heart icon toggle functionality in `PropertyCard`.
- Test database functions for adding/removing wishlist entries.

### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Test user flow from tapping heart icon to database update.
- Test authentication checks and login prompts.

### 6.3 E2E Tests
- Simulate user interaction with wishlist feature on both iOS and Android using Maestro.

## 7. Rollout Plan
- **Beta Release**: Roll out to 10% of users to gather feedback and monitor performance.
- **Full Release**: Gradual rollout to all users over a week, with monitoring for engagement and issues.
- **Post-Release**: Analyze usage data to assess feature success and identify areas for improvement.

## 8. Support and Maintenance
- **Support**: Provide in-app help documentation for wishlist feature.
- **Maintenance**: Monitor database performance for wishlist queries and optimize as needed.
- **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding a dedicated wishlist screen to view saved listings.

## 9. Appendix
- **References**: InstantDB documentation for schema updates and queries.
- **Glossary**:
  - Wishlist: A collection of user-saved property listings.
  - InstantDB: The database solution used for storing app data.
