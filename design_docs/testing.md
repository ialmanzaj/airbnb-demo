# Airbnb Clone - Testing Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing plan and requirements for the Airbnb Clone mobile application. The goal is to ensure the application meets functional requirements, provides a good user experience, and performs reliably across supported platforms. The application allows users to browse property listings, view details, and potentially interact with search and filtering features.

## 2. Goals

-   **Verify Functionality:** Ensure all core features work as expected according to specifications.
-   **Ensure Usability:** Validate that the application is intuitive, easy to navigate, and provides a smooth user experience.
-   **Assess Performance:** Check application responsiveness, load times, and resource usage under typical conditions.
-   **Confirm Compatibility:** Ensure the application functions correctly on target mobile operating systems (iOS and Android).
-   **Identify and Track Defects:** Log and manage bugs found during the testing process to ensure they are addressed before release.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope:

-   **Core Browsing Experience:**
    -   Displaying property listings (`(tabs)/index.tsx`).
    -   Viewing property details (`PropertyCard.tsx`, potentially navigating to a detail screen).
    -   Image carousel functionality within `PropertyCard.tsx`.
    -   Displaying property rating (`Rating.tsx`).
    -   Displaying property location and pricing information.
-   **Search and Filtering:**
    -   Basic search functionality (`SearchBar.tsx`).
    -   Filtering options (`FilterBar.tsx`).
    -   Applying filters to listing results (`(tabs)/search.tsx` or similar).
-   **Navigation:**
    -   Tab-based navigation (`(tabs)/_layout.tsx`).
    -   Navigation between list view and potentially detail views.
-   **UI/UX:**
    -   Visual consistency and adherence to design guidelines (implied by `constants/colors.ts`).
    -   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (partially handled by `Dimensions` in `PropertyCard.tsx`).
-   **Data Handling:**
    -   Fetching and displaying data from the backend (implied by `@instantdb/react-native` usage and `instant.schema.ts`).

### Out of Scope (Assumed):

-   User Authentication (Login/Signup) - *No clear components indicate this feature yet.*
-   Booking Functionality - *No clear components indicate this feature yet.*
-   User Profiles and Settings - *No clear components indicate this feature yet.*
-   Map View Integration - *No clear components indicate this feature yet.*
-   Backend infrastructure testing (API performance, database integrity - focus is on the client-side interaction).
-   Payment Processing.
-   Extensive performance/load testing beyond typical usage.
-   Automated E2E tests (unless specifically planned later).

## 4. Test Strategy

-   **Testing Types:**
    -   **Manual Testing:** Exploratory testing, usability testing, and execution of defined test cases.
    -   **Unit Testing:** (Future consideration) Testing individual components (`PropertyCard`, `Rating`, etc.) in isolation.
    -   **Integration Testing:** (Future consideration) Testing the interaction between components (e.g., `FilterBar` affecting listings).
    -   **Functional Testing:** Verifying features against requirements.
    -   **UI Testing:** Checking visual elements, layout, and responsiveness.
    -   **Compatibility Testing:** Testing on different devices and OS versions.
-   **Test Environment:**
    -   **Platforms:** iOS, Android.
    -   **Devices:** A mix of simulators/emulators and physical devices representing common screen sizes and OS versions (e.g., latest iOS/Android and one version back).
    -   **Build:** Development builds deployed via Expo Go or development client.
-   **Test Data:** Utilize mock data (`mocks/properties.ts`) and potentially test against a staging backend environment if available.
-   **Defect Tracking:** Use a bug tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira) to log, prioritize, and track defects.

## 6. Success Criteria

-   All High-priority test cases pass.
-   No critical or blocker bugs remain open.
-   Less than 5 High-priority bugs remain open.
-   The application is stable and does not crash during normal usage flows defined in test cases.
-   UI rendering is consistent across target platforms and major screen sizes.

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

-   **Risk:** Incomplete mock data may not cover all edge cases.
    -   **Mitigation:** Augment mock data based on testing needs or integrate with a staging backend early.
-   **Risk:** Lack of detailed specifications for some features (e.g., filter logic).
    -   **Mitigation:** Collaborate with development/product to clarify requirements before or during testing.
-   **Risk:** Limited device pool for compatibility testing.
    -   **Mitigation:** Prioritize testing on the most common devices/OS versions and leverage emulators/simulators extensively.
-   **Risk:** Performance issues on lower-end devices.
    -   **Mitigation:** Perform basic performance checks on representative lower-end devices or emulators.

## 8. Reporting

-   Regular test execution reports summarizing pass/fail rates and bug counts.
-   Detailed bug reports including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, screenshots/videos, device/OS information.
-   Final test summary report upon completion of the testing cycle.
