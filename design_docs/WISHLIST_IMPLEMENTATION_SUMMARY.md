# Wishlist Feature Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation process for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Wishlist feature, based on the tasks generated from [`wishlist-prd.txt`](mdc:scripts/wishlist-prd.txt).

## Completed Tasks

The following tasks were addressed and marked as 'done':

1.  **Task 1: Fix Component Errors in WishlistItemCard:** Resolved initial linter errors in `components/wishlist/WishlistItemCard.tsx`, primarily correcting import paths for `PriceDisplay` and `Rating`, and addressing incorrect prop usage (`size` on `Rating`, `price`/`period`/`className` on `PriceDisplay`). ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_001.txt))
2.  **Task 2: Fix Type Errors in Wishlist Screen:** Resolved linter errors in `app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx` by importing `WishlistItemCard` and replacing a local type definition with the more accurate shared type `WishlistItemWithListing`. ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_002.txt))
3.  **Task 3: Implement Wishlist Data Types:** Validated and updated the `WishlistItemWithListing` type in `types/wishlist.ts` to correctly use the schema-derived `ListingWithDetails` type for nested listing data, ensuring alignment with rule [`2003-types-from-schema.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/2003-types-from-schema.mdc). ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_003.txt))
4.  **Task 4: Implement Wishlist Data Fetching:** Updated the existing `getWishlist` hook in `lib/wishlist.ts` to explicitly query necessary nested fields (`location`, `pricing`, `images`) for linked listings, adhering to InstantDB best practices ([`2000-instant-db.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/2000-instant-db.mdc)). ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_004.txt))
5.  **Task 5: Implement Wishlist Item Removal:** Verified that the existing `removeFromWishlist` function in `lib/wishlist.ts` meets the requirements for deleting wishlist items using `db.transact`. ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_005.txt))
6.  **Task 6: Implement WishlistFavoriteButton Component:** Verified the existing `components/wishlist/WishlistFavoriteButton.tsx` component meets the core requirements for the wishlist screen context. Added `active:opacity-70` for better press feedback. ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_006.txt))
7.  **Task 7: Implement Empty State Component:** Verified that the existing `components/common/EmptyState.tsx` component meets the requirements. ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_007.txt))
8.  **Task 8: Implement Wishlist Screen UI States:** Verified that the existing logic in `app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx` correctly handles loading, error, and empty states based on the data from `getWishlist`. ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_008.txt))
9.  **Task 9: Implement Wishlist Grid with LegendList:** Verified that the existing `LegendList` implementation in `app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx` meets the core requirements (2 columns, `estimatedItemSize`, `keyExtractor`, `renderItem`, etc.) as per rule [`2002-legend-list.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/2002-legend-list.mdc). ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_009.txt))
10. **Task 10: Implement Navigation to Listing Details:** Verified that the existing `onPress` handler (`handleCardPress`) within `components/wishlist/WishlistItemCard.tsx` correctly implements navigation using `expo-router`. ([Task File](mdc:tasks_done/wishlist_prd/task_010.txt))

## Key Implementation Points

*   The core UI structure for displaying the wishlist (`app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx`) and individual items (`components/wishlist/WishlistItemCard.tsx`) is in place.
*   Data fetching (`getWishlist`) is configured to retrieve wishlist items along with necessary nested listing details (location, pricing, images).
*   Data types (`WishlistItemWithListing`, `ListingWithDetails`) are defined and aligned with the database schema query.
*   Functions for removing items (`removeFromWishlist`) exist.
*   UI states (loading, error, empty, populated) are handled in the main screen.
*   The list is rendered efficiently using `LegendList`.
*   Navigation from list items to detail screens is implemented.

## Learnings & Observations

*   **Task Master Cache:** The `next_task` command frequently returned stale data, requiring explicit fetching of tasks by ID to proceed reliably.
*   **Pre-existing Code:** Significant portions of the required functionality (removal function, empty state, UI states, navigation, list setup) were already present in the codebase. The implementation process often involved verification and minor adjustments rather than building from scratch.
*   **Iterative Debugging:** Fixing initial linter errors sometimes revealed subsequent issues (e.g., `PriceDisplay` props after fixing `Rating` props).
*   **Type Safety:** Linter errors highlighted the importance of using accurate, schema-derived types (`ListingWithDetails`) over potentially outdated manually defined types (`Property`) and ensuring data fetched matches component prop expectations. Rule [`2003-types-from-schema.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/2003-types-from-schema.mdc) proved crucial.
*   **InstantDB Query Specificity:** Explicitly defining nested fields in `db.useQuery` (Task 4) is necessary for fetching linked data correctly, as per rule [`2000-instant-db.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/2000-instant-db.mdc).
*   **Context-Specific Components:** `WishlistFavoriteButton` was simplified for its specific use case on the wishlist screen (always favorited, triggers removal).

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps

*   **Linter Error in `wishlist.tsx`:** A type error persists (line 60) indicating that the data passed to `LegendList` (from `getWishlist`) is missing `userId` and `listingId` properties expected by `WishlistItemWithListing`. This suggests the `db.useQuery` in `getWishlist` needs to be updated to fetch the base `wishlist` fields (`id`, `createdAt`, `status`, `userId`, `listingId`) in addition to the linked `listing` details. The current query only fetches `wishlist: { listing: { ... } }`. It should likely be `wishlist: { $: { select: [...] }, listing: { ... } }` or similar.
*   **Connect `onRemovePress`:** The `onRemovePress` prop in `WishlistItemCard` within `app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx` currently has a dummy function `() => {}`. This needs to be wired up to call the `removeFromWishlist` function from `lib/wishlist.ts`, passing the correct `item.id`.
*   **Testing:** No automated or manual tests (as outlined in task strategies) were performed during this implementation phase. Unit, integration, and potentially E2E tests should be added.
*   **Review User Changes:** Recent user edits introduced `ImageCarousel` and specific width calculations in `WishlistItemCard`. These changes should be reviewed for correctness and potential layout issues.
