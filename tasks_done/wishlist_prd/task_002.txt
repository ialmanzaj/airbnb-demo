# Task ID: 2
# Title: Fix Type Errors in Wishlist Screen
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve linter errors in the main wishlist.tsx screen related to imports and type mismatches.
# Details:
Fix the following issues in app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx:
1. Correct import paths for all components and hooks
2. Resolve any type mismatches between the data and component props
3. Ensure proper typing for state variables
4. Fix any TypeScript errors related to the screen implementation
5. Verify that all imports follow the project's import path conventions

# Test Strategy:
Run the linter to verify all errors are resolved. Manually test the screen with mock data to ensure it renders without TypeScript errors.
